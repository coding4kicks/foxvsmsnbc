# Fox versus MSNBC
### Is Fox more conservative or MSNBC more liberal

A silly display of 3 lists on a page.

According to wife, "Looks like a 14 year old boy's room."

Only possible use is as an easy way to display 3 scrolling lists, or 2 if you gut the middle one.  Redo the look.  Host as a static site on Amazon S3.  fvm.js then uses Backbone to reach back to S3 for the list info as JSON files.  Separates data from display.
